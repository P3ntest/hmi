# PVS
PVS is a tool to manage food and cooking for patients in hospitals or other medical institutions, making sure no allergies are triggered.

## Why?
I created this as a portfolio project to show my react, remix and prisma skills. Additionally I wanted to show a friend how easy this is.

## Functionality
You start off by registering patients, food, ingredients and allergies. The system then prints out possible food you can make for your patients.
