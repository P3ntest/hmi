# :sparkles: HMI :sparkles:
HMI (=Hospital Management Interface) is a tool to manage food and cooking for patients in hospitals or other medical institutions, making sure no allergies are triggered.

## :call_me_hand: Motivation
I created this as a portfolio project to show my react, remix and prisma skills. Additionally I wanted to show a friend how easy this is.

## :bulb: Functionality
You start off by registering patients, food, ingredients and allergies. The system then prints out possible food you can make for your patients.

## :gear: Technologies Used
This is a remix.run app using prisma as its ORM and MUI as it's frontend library. Database via SQL on Postgesql.
